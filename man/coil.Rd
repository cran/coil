\title{\pkg{coil}: evaluation of COI-5P barcode data}
\description{
\pkg{coil} is an R package designed for the cleaning, contextualization and assessment of cytochrome c oxidase I DNA
 barcode data (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c_oxidase_subunit_I}{COI-5P}, or the five prime portion of COI).
 It contains functions for placing COI-5P barcode sequences into a common reading frame, translating DNA sequences
 to amino acids and for assessing the likelihood that a given barcode sequence includes an insertion or deletion error.
 These functions are provided as a single function analysis pipeline and are also available individually for efficient
 and targeted analysis of barcode data.
}
\details{
\pkg{coil} is built around the custom `coi5p` object, which takes a COI-5P DNA barcode sequence as input.
 The package contains functions for: setting a sequence in reading frame, translating the sequence to amino acids
 and checking the sequence for evidence of insertion or deletion errors
}
\section{Functions}{

\itemize{
\item \code{\link{coi5p_pipe}} Run the entire coi5p analysis pipeline for an input sequence.
\item \code{\link{coi5p}} Builds a coi5p class object.
\item \code{\link{frame}} Sets the sequence into a common reading frame
\item \code{\link{which_trans_table}} Suggests a translation table for a taxonomic designation.
\item \code{\link{censored_translation}} Conducts translation, but ambigious codons are translated to placeholders.
\item \code{\link{translate}} Translate a DNA sequence to amino acids.
\item \code{\link{indel_check}} Check to see if an insertion or deletion error is likely.
